#Pipelines description

***CUSUM is a point change detector. It loops over all columns of the dataset and detects change 
when the cumulative sum is beyond a predefined threshold. In real time streaming, the detector waits for a batch of data points, 
then detects changes if any for a given batch.

***PageHinkley is also a drift detection method and works with only one column. At each timestamp the detector is updated with the new point and checks whether the new point is a change point.

***KSWIN (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Windowing) is a concept change detection method based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test. KS-test is a statistical test with no assumption of underlying data distribution. KSWIN maintains a sliding window fixed size n (window_size). The last r (stat_size) samples of window are considered as R. From the first nâˆ’r samples, r samples are uniformly drawn, are considered as W. A drift is detected if the distance between W and R is greater than a given threshold. (Implemented by KSWIN.py)

***Model(Logistic Regression) Based Change Detection it to monitor the evolution of performance indicators of the decision model, the indicatior should be trained offline, and will be used to detect change online in real time. This implementation monitors accuracy, recall and f1 over time and raise the red flag  when the values of these indicators are lower than the threshold 0.6.
