## Real-time change detection for monitoring Secure Water Treatment (SWaT)
iTrust Centre for Research in Cyber Security in collaboration with Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) hosts world class testbeds for experimentation aiming at the design of secure critical infrastructure. A dataset (SWaT.A4 & A5_Jul 2019) was collected under both normal operation and various attack scenarios. Change detection algorithms are useful in network security monitoring (NSM) for industrial plants like SWaT
